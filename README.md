Hello everyone!

I'm currently studying "Higher Technician in Multiplatform Application Development" to put it formally. In Spain, where I'm studying, it's called Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior, Desarollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma.

Currently, all my projects in this repo will be in Java, which is the language I'm studying at the moment. And being multilingual, the comments and exercices might be in multiple languages; English, Spanish, Catalan.

Since I am a student, who is learning, my projects aren't perfect, and I'm aware that there are way better solutions, but I'm locked by my lack of experience/knowledge or by the restrictions put by my educators. I still appriciate the feedback.

* Since these are graded assignments, AI use is prohibited, so all the work in this repo is fully coded with human sweat.

Thanks for checking out this repo, hope you can learn something or just check out the projects I've been working on.
